<?php
// Example PHP code to demonstrate how to solve some mathematical problems.
// This example demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and variables.

// Define two numbers
$number1 = 5;
$number2 = 3;

// Perform addition
$total = $number1 + $number2;

// Output the result
echo "The sum of {$number1} and {$number2} is: {$total}\n";

// Create a variable to store a number
$variable = 7;

// Use arithmetic operations with variables
$product = $variable * 3;
$squaredVariable = pow($variable, 2);

// Output the results
echo "The product of {$variable} and 3 is: $product\n";
echo "The square of {$variable} is: $squaredVariable\n";

// Example calculation involving variables
$totalVariables = $number1 + $number2;
$squareTotalVariables = pow($totalVariables, 2);

// Output the results of the calculations with variables
echo "\nTotal of {$number1} and {$number2}: {$totalVariables}\n";
echo "Square of the total: {$squareTotalVariables}\n";
